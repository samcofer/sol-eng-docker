# Welcome to the Auth Workshop!

This workshop (or series of workshops) is designed as an opinionated and "hands
on" playground for reproducing customer environments, trying different
authentication mechanisms, and learning through that process!!

What it is not:
- an introduction to our professional products. For this, see #team-admin-training
- a theoretical overview of the different auth providers and how they work. For
  this, see [this writeup]()
- a practical illustration of how auth providers work with our professional
  products. For this, see [this page]()

What it is:
- I want to set up SAML in 1 minute to see if I can reproduce a customer
  problem
- Let me try this `ldapsearch` command to be sure it works the way I thought
- I have some time. Let me try to configure RStudio Server Pro to use SAML for
  myself
- I either use `docker` or am interested in learning more about `docker`
