# Welcome to the Auth Workshop!

This workshop (or series of workshops) is designed as an opinionated and "hands
on" playground for reproducing customer environments on a desktop, trying
different authentication mechanisms, and learning about auth and our products
through that process!!

What it is not:
- an introduction to our professional products. For this, see #team-admin-training
- a theoretical overview of the different auth providers and how they work. For
  this, see [this
  writeup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGEeCsGoNGVKgmRPQCPISozXXdDwtuK3HqNhpZP7TOo/edit?usp=sharing)
- a practical overview of how auth providers work with our professional
  products. For this, see [this page](https://solutions.rstudio.com/auth/overview/)
- a "full" customer environment. For this, see
  [https://github.com/rstudio/sol-eng-terraform](https://github.com/rstudio/sol-eng-terraform)

What it is:
- I want to set up SAML in 1 minute to see if I can reproduce a customer
  problem
- Let me try this `ldapsearch` command to be sure it works the way I thought
- I have some time. Let me try to configure RStudio Server Pro to use SAML for
  myself
- I either use `docker` or am interested in learning more about `docker`

# Sounds Fun! What's next!?
