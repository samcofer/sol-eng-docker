# Proxied Authentication to RStudio #

This docker image installs RStudio Server Pro, as well as the necessary configuration for proxied authentication. 

## Getting Started ##

The license manager sees hardware and therefore will fail the trial license if you have ever had a trial license before.  As a result, you will either need an actual license to work with or you will need to go through the offline trial activation process at [http://apps.rstudio.com/trial-activation/](http://apps.rstudio.com/trial-activation/).
