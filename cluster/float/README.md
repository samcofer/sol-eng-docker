# Floating License Server

The paradigm used here has:
 - a single Dockerfile to build many images
 - a build arg for `PRODUCT` (one of `rsp`,`ssp`,`rspm`,`connect`,`rstudio`)
 - a build arg for `PORT` (to expose the port that you want... just for image
   reference later)
 - a dynamically mapped "default config file" based on `PRODUCT`
     - Note that this could easily be done with a `sed` command, since PORT is
       all that changes...
     - Further, this file is only read on service up, so we can honestly just
       map it in as a mount (no reason to embed in the image)

Check out the [compose file](../../compose/float.yml) that builds / starts
these images, using an environment variable to provide the LICENSE variable.
